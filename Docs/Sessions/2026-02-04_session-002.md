# Session 2026-02-04 - session-002 (Roadmap + Decisions)

## Goals
- Convert PRD into an implementation roadmap with milestones and a test strategy
- Lock decisions: state management, routing, environments (dev/prod), emulator usage

## Context
- Stack: Flutter + Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage, optional FCM)
- Constraints: French UI, no Admin role, mandatory seeding (Auth + Firestore), brand colors, QR attendance valid 3 minutes

## Atomic Tasks
1) Confirm the definitive scope for v1 (include/exclude optional items: FCM, forgot password, splash screen).
2) Decide state management (Riverpod recommended) and routing approach (go_router recommended).
3) Decide Cloud Functions style (callable recommended).
4) Define environment strategy:
   - study-planner-dev and study-planner-prod
   - local testing via Firebase Emulator Suite
5) Define naming conventions:
   - collection/document IDs
   - server timestamps
   - ISO week computation rules
6) Create detailed sessions (session-003..016) with atomic tasks and tests.

## Tests
- Not run (planning only)

## Errors
- None

## Outputs
- Docs/Sessions/*.md

## Next Steps
- Session-003: Flutter bootstrap + Firebase init + localization + theme + logo
